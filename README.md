Implementation of the Genotype-Corrector program for correction and imputation of genotypic data on the server

The two files included in this repository can be used to implement the Genotype-Corrector software on a server. The different parameters indicated in this code are well explained in the paper (Miao et al. 2018) where this software was published (please do not forget to cite it). This repository is intended to provide an example of how this software can be used for an F2 population.
